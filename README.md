# Database-Creation-and-Querying
A Jupyter Notebook that processes a dataset extracted from the Reddit subreddit r/peloton, focusing on discussions about the 2021 Tour de France.
The notebook guides through creating a relational MySQL database, handling missing values using Pandas, defining tables, and populating them with extracted data. It includes SQL queries to analyze user engagement, comment scores, moderator interventions, and keyword mentions, among other insights. The project utilizes Python, MySQL, and pymysql for execution, ensuring seamless data processing and querying.
To run the notebook, ensure MySQL is installed, load .ipynb in Jupyter Notebook, and execute all cells sequentially.
